A modular compiler toolchain for the SPL programming language, developed from the ground up. This project includes a full compilation pipeline — from lexical analysis to code generation — targeting the Simple Stack Machine (SSM), a virtual stack-based machine modeled after MIPS and Dr. Montagne’s VM. The toolchain also includes a custom SPL parser, AST-based declaration checker, and SSM bytecode generator.
